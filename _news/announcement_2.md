Successfully completed my Master of Science in Computational Science and Engineering at McMaster University. My thesis focused on the application of machine learning techniques in quantitative finance, with particular emphasis on developing advanced algorithms for financial modeling and risk assessment.

This milestone represents a significant step in my academic journey, combining theoretical foundations in computational science with practical applications in financial technology. The program provided me with deep expertise in:

- **Advanced Machine Learning**: Neural networks, deep learning architectures, and optimization algorithms
- **Computational Finance**: Quantitative modeling, risk management, and algorithmic trading strategies  
- **Data Science**: Statistical analysis, time series forecasting, and big data processing
- **Software Engineering**: High-performance computing and scalable system design

Looking forward to applying these skills in my research at Vector Institute!
