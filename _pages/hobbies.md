## Personal Interests

Beyond my research in AI and computational finance, I have several passions that enrich my life and often inspire my work.

### â˜• Coffee Enthusiast

I'm deeply passionate about coffee culture and the art of brewing. From perfecting espresso shots to exploring pour-over methods, I find joy in every aspect of coffee preparation. I occasionally roast my own beans, experimenting with different profiles to bring out unique flavors. The precision and attention to detail required in coffee brewing mirrors the methodical approach I bring to my research.

### ðŸ¥¾ Urban Exploration & Hiking

I love walking through downtown areas, observing the rhythm of city life and how people navigate their daily routines. There's something profound about spending a sunny afternoon just watching the world go by - life feels different in those moments of quiet observation. When I need to escape the urban environment, I enjoy hiking, where the combination of physical activity and natural beauty provides the perfect mental reset.

### ðŸ“¸ Fine Art Photography

During my undergraduate years, I seriously pursued fine art photography, developing an eye for composition, light, and storytelling through images. This artistic pursuit taught me to see patterns and beauty in unexpected places, a skill that surprisingly translates well to recognizing patterns in data and research.

### ðŸŽ¼ Classical Music

I'm an devoted admirer of classical music, with immense respect for Ludwig van Beethoven. His ability to convey profound emotion and mathematical precision in his compositions resonates with my appreciation for both the artistic and analytical aspects of complex systems. Classical music often accompanies my research sessions, providing the perfect backdrop for deep thinking.
