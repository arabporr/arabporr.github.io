I'm a Computational Science & Engineering M.Sc. candidate at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/) (GPA 3.9/4.0, full scholarship) with a passion for the intersection of deep learning and problem solving. I am currently working on **geometric deep learning in finance**. As a graduate student at McMaster and Vector Institute, I've built and optimized **hypernetworks** that approximate complex stochastic processes, parallelizing them across multi-GPU clusters to slash compute times by over **60×**.

I'm currently innovating in **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** to make large-scale models faster, more accessible/sustainable, and cheaper to run. My academic journey began with a B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Tehran, where I earned a **Bronze medal in ACM ICPC West Asia**, and I have since explored a broad spectrum of machine learning methodologies, from architecture design to optimization and evaluation.

As **co-founder and quantitative researcher**, I engineered evolutionary-algorithm-driven trading strategies and conducted extensive Monte Carlo backtesting to maximize risk-adjusted returns. I've equally valued both industry and academic experiences, **TA'd three graduate-level** machine learning and finance-related courses at McMaster, supported over **500 undergraduate students** in Python, and organized **bi-weekly CSE seminars** that bridged cutting-edge theory with real-world applications.

I'm always keen to connect with fellow researchers and practitioners in deep learning and finance.

## Research Interests
- **Geometric Deep Learning**: Hypernetworks and manifold-based approaches for finance
- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning**: Making LLMs more accessible and sustainable
- **Computational Finance**: Stochastic processes and quantitative modeling
- **Machine Learning**: From theoretical foundations to practical applications
- **High-Performance Computing**: Multi-GPU optimization and parallel computing

## Recent Highlights
- **ICML 2025 Workshop**: Accepted paper on CPU-efficient LLM fine-tuning
- **60× Speedup**: Achieved through multi-GPU hypernetwork optimization
- **Vector Institute**: Faculty Affiliate Researcher position
- **Academic Excellence**: 3.9/4.0 GPA with full scholarship at McMaster
- **Competition Success**: Bronze medal in ACM ICPC West Asia

## Publications
- **"LoRA Fine-Tuning Without GPUs: A CPU-Efficient Meta-Generation Framework for LLMs"** (2025) - *ICML Workshop*
- **"Low-dimensional approximations of the conditional law of Volterra processes: a non-positive curvature approach"** (2024) - *arXiv*

## Current Work
As a Faculty Affiliate at Vector Institute, I collaborate on cutting-edge research projects that bridge theoretical advances with practical applications, making AI more accessible and developing novel approaches to financial modeling challenges.
