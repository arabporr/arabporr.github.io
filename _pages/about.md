I am a Faculty Affiliate Researcher at the [Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) and hold an MSc in Computational Science and Engineering from [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/). My research focuses on the intersection of **deep learning**, **machine learning**, and **quantitative finance**, with particular expertise in efficient model adaptation and mathematical finance applications.

My work spans theoretical foundations and practical implementations, including **CPU-efficient fine-tuning methods for large language models** and **low-dimensional approximations for complex stochastic processes** in mathematical finance. I am passionate about making advanced AI techniques more accessible and developing novel approaches to challenging problems in computational finance.

## Research Interests
- **Efficient AI Systems**: CPU-efficient training and fine-tuning methods for large language models
- **Mathematical Finance**: Stochastic processes, Volterra processes, and volatility modeling
- **Deep Learning**: Neural network architectures, meta-learning, and hypernetworks  
- **Computational Finance**: Quantitative modeling and algorithmic approaches
- **Dimension Reduction**: Manifold learning and non-positive curvature approaches
- **Transfer Learning**: Parameter-efficient adaptation and LoRA methods

## Recent Publications
- **"LoRA Fine-Tuning Without GPUs: A CPU-Efficient Meta-Generation Framework for LLMs"** (2025) - *arXiv:2507.01806* | **Accepted to ICML 2025 Workshop**
- **"Low-dimensional approximations of the conditional law of Volterra processes: a non-positive curvature approach"** (2024) - *arXiv:2405.20094*

## Current Work
As a Faculty Affiliate at Vector Institute, I collaborate on cutting-edge research projects that bridge theoretical advances with practical applications, making AI more accessible and developing novel approaches to financial modeling challenges.
