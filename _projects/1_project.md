### 🎯 Problem Statement

Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning has become essential for domain-specific applications, but the GPU requirement creates a significant barrier for researchers with limited computational resources. Our work addresses this critical challenge by developing a theoretically grounded approach that enables effective LoRA fine-tuning on standard laptop CPUs.

### 💡 Key Innovation

The core breakthrough lies in our **meta-learning approach** that learns to map any input dataset (represented as a probability distribution) to a set of LoRA weights by leveraging a large bank of pre-trained adapters. Instead of performing new gradient-based updates, our pipeline constructs adapters via lightweight combinations of existing LoRAs directly on CPU.

#### 🔬 Technical Architecture

```
Input Dataset → Distribution Representation → Meta-Operator → LoRA Combination → Fine-tuned Model
```
