## RNN Game-Theoretic Decision Making

This project explores the intersection of deep learning and game theory, investigating how Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) can model and predict strategic decision-making behaviors in multi-agent environments. The work combines sequential modeling with game-theoretic principles to understand complex strategic interactions.

### Research Objective

The primary goal is to develop RNN-based models that can:
