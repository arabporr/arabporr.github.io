### 🎯 Research Motivation

Predicting the conditional evolution of Volterra processes with stochastic volatility is a crucial challenge in mathematical finance. While deep neural network models offer promise in approximating the conditional law of such processes, their effectiveness is hindered by the curse of dimensionality caused by the infinite dimensionality and non-smooth nature of these problems.

### 💡 Novel Approach

We propose a **two-step solution** that combines advanced mathematical techniques with geometric deep learning:

#### 🔬 Step 1: Stable Dimension Reduction
- Project the law of Volterra processes onto a **low-dimensional statistical manifold**
- Utilize **non-positive sectional curvature** properties for stability
- Preserve essential geometric and probabilistic structures

#### 🧠 Step 2: Geometric Deep Learning
- **Sequentially deep learning model** tailored to the manifold's geometry
- **Auxiliary hypernetwork** to dynamically update internal parameters
- **Non-stationary dynamics encoding** for time-dependent processes

### 🏗️ Technical Architecture
