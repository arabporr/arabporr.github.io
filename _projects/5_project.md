**💰 Quantitative Finance** | **🤖 Machine Learning** | **📊 Derivatives Pricing**

### 🎯 Project Overview

This project explores the application of traditional machine learning algorithms to option pricing problems, bridging quantitative finance with modern data science techniques. The work demonstrates how classical ML methods can effectively capture complex market dynamics for accurate derivatives pricing, moving beyond traditional Black-Scholes limitations.

### 💡 Research Motivation

Financial derivatives pricing has traditionally relied on mathematical models like Black-Scholes, which make strong assumptions about market behavior:

#### 🔍 Traditional Model Limitations:
- **Constant Volatility**: Real markets exhibit time-varying volatility
- **Normal Returns**: Market returns often show fat tails and skewness
- **No Transaction Costs**: Real trading involves significant costs
- **Continuous Trading**: Markets have gaps and discontinuities

#### 🚀 Machine Learning Advantages:
- **Data-Driven Approach**: Learn patterns directly from market data
- **Non-Linear Relationships**: Capture complex market dynamics
- **Regime Adaptation**: Adapt to changing market conditions
- **Multi-Factor Models**: Incorporate multiple risk factors simultaneously
